FrostWolf
=============
This is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin which allows players on a server to turn into a FrostWolf. FrostWolves are creatures which gain special abilities during the night.

Players have a chance of becoming a FrostWolf by being bitten by a wolf in any winter biome.


Permissions
===========
FrostWolf.frostWolf (Default true) - This permission allows players to be able to become FrostWolves when they are bitten.
FrostWolf.toggleWolf (Default true) - Allow use of /togglewolf, which will turn a player into a wolf (or turn them back to normal).
